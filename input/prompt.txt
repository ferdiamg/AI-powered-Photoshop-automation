Create a table that summarizes the top responses to this thread: 
"{posttitle}"
Top 5 answers:
"{ top5answers }"

And give me an irreverent title so I can make a TikTok carousel post out of it.
IMPORTANT: Respond only with the table with title and responses, where each response has the text (NO FIRST-PERSON-PERSPECTIVE, NOT MORE THAN 40 WORDS NOT LESS THAN 20!) and short_title (NOT LESS THAN 5 WORDS!) as a json! Don't output anything else!
